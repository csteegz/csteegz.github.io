  Hi, I'm Colin
</h3>
<p>
I'm a developer in Seattle, WA working for Twitter.

Previously, I was working for Microsoft on <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/machine-learning/service/">Azure Machine Learning.</a>
I've developed Azure ML's Hardware Accelerated Model Service, powered by <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/project-brainwave/">Project Brainwave</a>, which led to a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.08986">paper</a>, as well as working on <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/tree/master/onnxruntime/server">ONNX Runtime Server.</a>
